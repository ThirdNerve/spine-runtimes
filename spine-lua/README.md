# spine-lua

The spine-lua runtime provides functionality to load and manipulate [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com) skeletal animation data using [Lua](http://www.lua.org/). It does not perform rendering but can be extended to enable Spine animations for other Lua-based projects.

## Setup

1. Download the Spine Runtimes source using [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) or by downloading it [as a zip](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/archive/master.zip).
1. Copy the contents of the `spine-lua` directory into your project.
